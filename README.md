# DeepPneumo – Pediatric Chest X-Ray Classification with CNN & Grad-CAM  
  
**Technologies:** Python | PyTorch | CNN | ResNet | Grad-CAM | NumPy | Matplotlib  

---

##  Overview  
**DeepPneumo** is a deep learning–based model designed to classify pediatric chest X-rays as either **Normal** or **Pneumonia**.  
Using a **ResNet-based CNN**, the model learns to detect pneumonia patterns and leverages **Grad-CAM visualizations** to interpret which lung regions influence predictions.  

This prototype demonstrates how AI can enhance diagnostic decision support systems in the medical imaging domain.
